# Phishing Attack Python

This is a Python script that demonstrates how an attacker could use the `smtplib` module to send a phishing email. The email is disguised as a legitimate message from a bank or online service provider and asks the victim to verify their account information by clicking on a link. However, the link actually takes the victim to a fake website designed to steal their account credentials.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply clone the repository or copy and paste the code into a Python file to run the script.

## Usage

To use this script, open the file in a Python IDE or text editor and replace the `sender_email`, `receiver_email`, `smtp_server`, `username`, and `password` variables with your own email addresses and SMTP server credentials. Then, run the script to send the phishing email.

It is important to note that using this code for any illegal or unethical activities, including phishing attacks, is strictly prohibited. This code is provided for educational purposes only and serves as a demonstration of how attackers can use technology to exploit human vulnerabilities.
